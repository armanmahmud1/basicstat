# basicstat
Run this command to know the basic statistics for both string and numeric variables of a dataset.

## Description
This command produces two Excel files, "basicstat_string_output.xlsx" and "basicstat_numeric_output.xlsx", that summarize key statistics from a dataset. For string variables, it generates frequency tables, with each variable placed on its own sheet within the string output file. For numeric variables, the command first checks whether the number of observations is greater than zero. If so, it compiles a comprehensive set of statistics for each variable, including the variable name, number of observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), skewness, kurtosis, minimum and maximum values, and percentiles at the 25th (P25), 50th (P50), and 75th (P75) levels. This structured output provides a quick and organized overview of data.

## Installing process
```
net install basicstat, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/armanmahmud1/basicstat/main/") replace
```
## Example code
```
basicstat using "D:\test_dataset\Practice_clean.dta"

```	
```
